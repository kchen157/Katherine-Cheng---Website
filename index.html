        <p class="lead mb-4">My passion for teaching can be traced back to high school. Tutoring other students and helping them learn was always felt like a reward rather than work. While I worked in non-profit organizations, like Kids2Kids, I found that I get the most excited about sharing knowledge. Whether it be helping my friends study for a class or tutoring high school students in Trigonometry, I am always there to find a way to explain difficult concepts in different ways. Right now, I am currently a UCR student who is trying to get my BA in Economics and a minor in Accounting. I have always felt that math and science was my strong suit, but once I took Economics in highschool I connected with it. However, Economics did not come to me as easily at the start. Once I was able to switch my lens, I was able to help and collaborate with others about the subject. Economic can be hard at first, but it gets easier the more you explain the concepts in different ways. Even though Economics is a social science, I think it explains a lot about this unknown world of money that capitalism has created. Other than Economics, I love math. I really struggled with math as I was growing up, and doing math problems on the dinner table with my parents during elementary school was a rough time. However, as I practiced more and more I found that math was like another language and being able to understand how numbers can interact was how I was able to break out of the helmet on my head and open myself to different concepts and solutions. Accounting has become a recent favorite of mine in college. When I took my first accounting class, I realized that accounting is not all about keeping track of the books. Accounting has to be able to work within the system but at the same time must help the firm maximize its goal. In order to think like an accountant, there are steps there must not be forgotten. Just like a mouse finding its way out of a puzzle is how I see accounting. There are a lot of things the world can teach us, but in order to understand them, it takes time and effort with the right teacher in the right learning environment. I used to think that learning was about memorization and countless hours of studying, but after being in the school system for so long I’ve figured that in order to learn in a classroom setting the student has to be able to temporarily remove themselves from the way that they usually think, and try to see the lesson in the way that the teacher understands the lesson. Many times, this way of thinking does work either from the teacher’s end or the student’s end. I hope that when I become a teacher I am able to explain concepts and solutions that ways so that everyone is able to learn.  
<br><br>

        Outside of the classroom setting. I am an introvert. Usually do not like to drink or meet a lot of new people at once, so rather than going out to party I would rather stay home and watch T.V. For group projects, I usually lead if there is no one else with more confidence to do it, but I feel like I do lack the confidence to try new things. I am trying to change that this year as I am joining more clubs and going to more events. All of these moments are like highs for me because I was not about to experience this before, but at the same time it is very exhausting for an introvert. I have to be focused on what I am saying and be careful what I say, how I am, or how I come off to people. I do not want to sound rude or intrusive by asking so many questions and I also do not want others to be annoyed if I am only talking about myself. There are some moments when I know that the person I am talking to is not interested in me, and these moments are what is hard to stop thinking about. In highschool, it was slightly easier for me because I had my family in colorguard, but after going off to college it's nice that no one knows you, but at the same time that makes me want to rebrand myself. It is not easy to just go and become another person since I have already found a really good people in my life and I do not want to change myself just because I want to look good in front of others, but I feel like everyone would rather get along with everyone instead of hiding in their circle. I have people that I do not like very much as well, but I feel like I have to get over the fact that I do not have to stick to people I do not like and they do not have to be around for me either. I guess you can call meeting people like a game of process of elimination so see which people are actually worth your time. For me, things are slightly looking up since I have joined a club on campus called Senryu Taiko. The people there feel like they are a family and they are really hard working and supportive. I can not call them my family yet since I have not truly proven myself yet, but I have hope for the future. I am making big leaps this year and even though I am not exactly comfortable, I am gaining new experiences. Currently I am trying not to think too much about what I am doing in each situation, but instead, I am trying to learn how to adjust to new people and environments. That was my little speech on how I am slowly trying to evolve as a person in college.
<br><br>

        I know that this is supposed to be a bio of myself, and I am sorry for my TA if she actually reads this, but I do not know how I am supposed to write 1,500 words about myself. I feel like I can either write 400 words about myself or 100,000 words about myself, but everyone is complex and works in different ways. Like I wrote before, for me I am an introvert so it was hard for my to learn in school because I never sought out help from my teachers or friends and that I would rather struggle by myself. In today’s society, everyone is expected to struggle at one point in their lives and that is what helps us grow as a people. I appreciate my younger self for being able to being able to catch up, but I think that I could have sought out help from others so that I can learn beyond what I did in school. Now that I am older, I look back at all the tutors and teachers I had, and I understand now that they want me to ask questions and that they want me to learn, but in the kinds of classroom settings that we have today I think it is very hard for kids to have the courage to ask because of the judgement of others. This kind of judgment does not even have to be negative judgement, it just another caption that gets stuck onto the kid’s image. As a kid you do not care about small sayings, but as you grow older these small captions that label use affect how you act. How much these captions affect the person is, what I think, make a person introverted or extroverted. It is not like the extrovert do not think about these captions at all, but they have the ability to brush it off easier. For an introvert, we think too much and the more we think the more we get caught up in past experiences or memories. As we keep thinking, we continue to build this wall of self loathing and the only thing that can stop us from thinking is to be with people that are accepting for all the time you slip up or say something dumb and will laugh with you at the moment so that your memory of a end moment can end there as a good memory. Alright, now I am done with talk about personalities and social personalities. I really hope you did not get this far into my bio since it got kind of dark, but if you’re wondering how I am going to tie this all up here is my go at it. I guess why I want to become a teacher is because I think that the minds of young adults are so malleable and fragile. They can learn so much and they are so creative, but if you put them in the wrong school or in the wrong class they can break. I want to become a teacher so that I can carry my students to the finish line without them falling. Also, I hope my writing is not being  graded please just focus on my coding.
